      <h1>Pharmacometrics Study Group Handbook</h1>
      <h2>Pharmacometrics Study Groups are a fun and informal way to meet up with friends and colleagues to share skills and get help with problems in your research by working together. This handbook describes how to start and run your own Study Group.</h2>

        <h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The open science movement presents many opportunities to reimagine the way we do research. Evidence continues to  mount that the  open publication of <a href='https://peerj.com/articles/175/'>data</a> and <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418'>papers</a> benefits the researchers who  publish them, and the creation, modification and reuse of software is becoming <a href='https://zenodo.org/record/14809#.VZMzfqbe-nc'>commonplace</a> in many fields of research. And yet, few places exist to  support and encourage the exploration of these skills and ideas; where does a  researcher go to learn these techniques and start these conversations?</p>

        <p>It's possible to explore these opportunities effectively today by creating a <strong>Pharmacometrics Study Group</strong>. Pharmacometrics Study Groups are regular meetups for staticians, clinical pharmacologists, pharmacometricians, drug developers and clinical scientists to improve their technical and soft skills, learn new tools, and work openly  together to share solutions. We'd like to achieve three main goals in a Study Group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skill Sharing.</strong> A good Pharmacometrics Study Group shares lessons on asking the right questions, open science skills, from freely learning and discussing new tools, to learning technical skills, to communicating our results to decision makers in an efficient manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Idea Discovery.</strong> There is a rich world of open-source code & open science strategies to support research, but these can be hard to discover on our own. A Pharmacometrics Study Group brings the experiences of many researchers together to help you discover tools, code and projects to supercharge your research.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Support.</strong> Learning how to work with data and code can be isolating, stressful and time consuming for many early career researchers. A Pharmacometrics Study Group gives people a place to ask questions, get help and receive encouragement on their path to learning open research practices and technologies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Chapter</h2>
        <p>In <a href="event-types.html">Event Ideas</a>, we'll propose different events that can be hosted for our Study Group. This is just a guide and not intended to be rule book. If you are conducting events that are of a different nature, please let us know and we will put them up here.</p>
